## Retail Software
I'm developing this system to consolidate my understanding of what I've been learning about the Java language. In this program, I've been able to apply the main concepts of object-oriented programming, such as:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes
- Constructors
- Interface

In addition to working with lists and loops. The project is not yet finished, I intend to implement the database and maybe integrate with an API. Before developing the project, I created a UML diagram that, although it underwent some changes during the code creation process, served as a good basis for thinking about the overall business concept and working on the relationship between objects and class inheritance.

## How to execute this program
<font color="red">*Before anything else, check if you have the Java SDK 17+ installed, and consult the download on the Oracle website.*</font><br><br>
If you want to follow along with the project I'm developing and run it on your machine, simply download the 'sistema-mercado.jar' file and place it inside your 'users' folder on your C drive. This is optional; you can place it in any folder, but if you want to run it without much hassle navigating through directories, I recommend this path. Once done, open your command prompt or cmd and execute the command 'java -jar sistema-mercado.jar'. After pressing Enter, you'll have access to the program, where the login is:

- User: User
- Password: 123
